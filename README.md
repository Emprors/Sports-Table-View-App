#### Sports-Table-View-App

This repository has the source code of my the midterm project for the SCS_2680_010 iOS Mobile Application Development 
inside Ontario Institute for Studies in Education - University of Toronto.


Sports Table View is an application that will allow the user to view a list of sports games read from a JSON file.
The application will use a Navigation Controller to display three table views.
- The first view will let the user choose a week
- The second view will let the user choose a sport
- The third view will display a list of games for that sport
